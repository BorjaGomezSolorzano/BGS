# BGS

This repository contains backtest results, factsheets and other stuff about the [BGS](https://www.darwinex.com/invest/BGS?utm_source=sharelanding&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=shareownlanding&utm_content=Borja) darwin.

The goal is to be as open as posible without compromissing the algo trading logic.

The real execution is based on my Metatrader-Bridge repository.
